# 20-days-ML-in-R

This repository contains **notes**, **exercises**, and **code** created while completing the *Introduction to Machine Learning with R* learning track from Simplilearn SkillUp . The work is organized as a focused **20‑day journey** to build strong fundamentals in machine learning using **R**.

## Repository structure

- `ML in R Certification Course/` – Main working directory with **daily folders**, R scripts, and notebooks that follow the course lessons and practice activities.  
- `.gitignore` – Rules to exclude **temporary**, **cache**, and **large output** files (such as `.Rhistory`, `.Rproj.user`, and generated data) from version control.  
- `README.md` – Overview of the project, **setup instructions**, and **learning roadmap**.

## Course overview

The *Introduction to Machine Learning with R* course is a **free**, beginner‑friendly program of around **10 hours** of self‑paced content. It introduces **R programming from scratch** and then moves into essential **machine learning algorithms** and their applications.

**Main themes of the course:**

- Machine learning **basics**, terminology, and real‑world applications.  
- R programming **foundations**: setup, variables, data types, operators, and basic syntax.  
- Working with core R **data structures**: vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames.  
- Data manipulation with **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**, and data visualization in R.  
- Supervised learning in R: **linear regression**, **logistic regression**, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.  
- Unsupervised learning: **hierarchical clustering** in R.  
- **Time series** analysis in R and its basic use cases.

## Learning goals

This repository is meant to show **consistent progress** and **practical understanding** of the course content.

By the end of the **20 days**, the goals are to:

- Understand fundamental **machine learning concepts** and when to apply different types of algorithms.  
- Write **clean R code** for loading, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data.  
- Build, tune, and evaluate basic **regression** and **classification** models in R using real or sample datasets.  
- Apply **clustering** and simple **time series** models to explore patterns in data.  
- Maintain a clear, well‑structured project that can be shared as a **portfolio artifact**.

## 20‑day study plan

An example structure for the 20‑day journey (adapt to your actual progress):

- **Days 1–3:** R setup, syntax, variables, data types, vectors, lists, matrices, data frames, and **control flow**.  
- **Days 4–5:** Functions in R, data manipulation with **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**, and basic visualization.  
- **Days 6–8:** Machine learning **fundamentals**, problem framing, and exploratory data analysis.  
- **Days 9–12:** **Linear regression** and **logistic regression** in R, including model evaluation metrics.  
- **Days 13–15:** **Decision trees**, **random forests**, and **SVM** in R, plus handling overfitting and basic tuning.  
- **Days 16–17:** **Hierarchical clustering** and interpretation of clusters.  
- **Days 18–19:** **Time series analysis** in R: decomposition and basic forecasting ideas.  
- **Day 20:** **Mini‑project** that combines data cleaning, modeling, and visualization into a single end‑to‑end workflow.  

Create a markdown note for each day (for example `Day01.md`) to log what was learned, link to scripts, and record reflections or **next steps**.
